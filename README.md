# Commlab-Assignment-2

* Project Name
Roots

* Project Description: what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.
This is a survival web comic portrayed as cave art. We want to show the readers a peak what it was like living in the stone age, and surprise them at the end.

* Process: How did you go about implementing the concept.
We used Procreate and Adobe Illustrator for the drawings and added interactivity to the comic by giving the reader the option to click on buttons and make choices for survival.

* Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.
The drawings exceeded our expectations and we really liked how they turned out. Everything went very smooth and exactly as planned in the brainstorming session.
